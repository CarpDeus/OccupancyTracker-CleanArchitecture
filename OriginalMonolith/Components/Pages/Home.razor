    Welcome to the Occupancy Tracker, an idea that happened during the COVID-19 lockdown when
    occupancy of buildings like stores was highly restricted and there were people at each entrance that kept
    track of the number of people entering and exiting. I thought that would be an interesting application to
    architect and build, however, I had no time to do that during lockdown as I was kept pretty busy. Then I
    realized it would be the perfect vehicle to discuss some concepts in building Secure, Scalable, Software
    as a Service (SSSaaS) applications.
